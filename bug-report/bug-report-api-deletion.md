### üîÅ Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to the **User Management** section  
2. Open the **Client Credentials** tab  
3. Select an existing client credential  
4. Attempt to delete the selected credential

---

### Expected Result
The selected client credential should be successfully deleted, the total count should be updated, and the interface should allow the creation of a new credential if under the limit.

---

### Actual Result
An error message appears:  **'The operation could not be completed due to an internal error'**.  
The credential remains undeleted.

---

### Notes & Impact

- Blocks users from managing their client credentials effectively.
- Prevents deletion even if within the credential limit (e.g., 10 max), affecting API key rotation and cleanup processes.
- No recovery or retry mechanism shown in the UI after the error.

---

### Suggested Fix

- Investigate backend exception thrown during the deletion request.
- Improve error messaging for clarity (e.g., 'Credential is in use', 'Permission denied').
- Ensure client credentials are not linked to active services before deletion.
